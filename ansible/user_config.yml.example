# Please specify the mnemonic or privateKey for the wallet(s) you are using to stake your tokens following the following example
# Also account index can be provided

# The `wallets` section specifies the details of the wallets used in the Media Edge application.
# Each wallet can be identified either by a mnemonic phrase or a private key.
# The `mnemonic` field is used to specify the mnemonic phrase for the wallet.
# The `supportedChains` field lists the IDs of the blockchain networks that the wallet supports.
# The `accountIndex` field is optional and specifies the index of the account in the mnemonic; it defaults to 0 if not provided.
# The `privateKey` field is used to specify the private key for the wallet. Must have the following format: "0x<64-characters-hexadecimal-string>".

# *** CAUTION *** If not sure on how to fill the mnemonic or privateKey, leave it blank and a prompt will kindly guide you to fill every needed item.

    #  If prefer to use mnemonic phrase instead of private key uncomment the following line, fill the mnemonic field and comment the privateKey field.
    #  mnemonic: "some mnemonic example"
    #  accountIndex: 1 # The index of the account in the mnemonic. If not provided, defaults to 0
    privateKey: "your private Key"
    supportedChains: [11155111] # Specify comma separated if supporting multiple chains
    cname: [cname.yourdomain.com] # Please specify cname to provide on your origin. Take into account that by pointing *.yourdomain.com to your edges ips, you will be able to use the same cname for all your edges.
    a_record: [xxxx.xxxx.xxxx.xxxx] #Should be the ip or your edges's server. If have more than one, specify all the ips by separating by commas.


# Please specify the networks you are providing services (where you are staking your tokens).
