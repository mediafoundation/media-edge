## About Media Edge

Media Edge is a new and powerful software that allows CDN providers to create their content delivery network and sell their services in the decentralized Media Network marketplace. With the Media Edge, providers can easily set up their CDN networks, offer them within the Media Network marketplace, and get MEDIA rewards in exchange for the services provided.

## What is Media Edge?

Media Edge is an open-source software that serves as a web server and blockchain resource manager for CDN providers. It is a tool that simplifies the process of setting up a CDN network, and it includes all the necessary features to interact with the Media Network smart contracts from the provider stand point.
